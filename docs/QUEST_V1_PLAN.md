# Maestro Quest 1.0 delivery record

Status: active implementation. Nothing in this document claims store readiness.

## Accepted product scope

- Native Unity mixed-reality app for a long-term Meta Quest Store release.
- The same Maestro tutor implementation and managed services, with a versioned
  native bridge. Preserve the familiar language, chat, suggestions, audio and
  artifact behavior; do not fork prompts or implement a second tutor in C#.
- Pencil contours and opaque watercolor based on the user's Scetch-War project.
  All included models and user creations share this Penzil-inspired spatial
  drawing style; see QUEST_ART_DIRECTION.md (user steering 2026-09-25).
- Animated physical book with two selectable layouts using the same components
  and session. Default conversation layout: familiar phone chat on the right,
  preceding chat on the left, artifacts inline, older history on earlier pages.
  Optional practice layout: chat left, selected/latest artifact right, clickable
  artifact previews in chat. Retain the message-identity bookmark as a ribbon.
- Both page surfaces are filled with content. Add no book headers, counters,
  toolbars or layout menus to the page image. New interactions outside the pages
  must be physical 3D objects, not floating flat panels (user steering 2026-09-25).
- Included full-body animated Maestro, based on the existing Maestro persona.
  Support idle, attentive listening, speaking, greeting and pointing; page turns
  and appearance animations respect reduced-motion settings.
- User-created room items: in-app editor and GLB/VRM imports first, as selected
  by the user on 2026-09-25. Include playback of compatible imported animations.
  AI text-to-3D and public content sharing are outside this first release.
- Default book and avatar are included and usable without downloading assets.
- Hand/controller interaction, comfortable seated/standing placement, save/load,
  recovery, bounded content/resource use, import validation, and accessible text.

## Repository and development ownership

Worktree: `C:/Users/ronit/.codex/worktrees/maestro-quest-v1/MaestroTutor`.
Branch: `codex/maestro-quest-v1`.
Unity project: `unity/MaestroQuest`. Shared web integration belongs in
`src/platform/quest` and minimal feature presentation adapters.
The existing web/Capacitor application remains supported.

## Delivery sequence

1. Establish supported Unity/Android toolchain, pinned package provenance and
   batch compile/test/build commands; evaluate a maintained browser texture path.
2. Build the physical book, illustrated materials and desktop simulation scene.
   Prove an actual Maestro page and interactive artifact on the book.
3. Add the shared-runtime bridge, page layout, artifact routing and bookmark
   behavior with semantic parity tests and app lifecycle coordination.
4. Ship the included rigged avatar and animations; bind actual tutor activity and
   playback to its visual state without opening extra model/audio sessions.
5. Implement scene object creation, validated import, animation control, editing,
   persistence, undo and recovery. Reject executable content in model packages.
6. Integrate Quest passthrough, placement, hands/controllers, native capabilities,
   authentication/attestation and managed access. Verify physical device behavior.
7. Complete release gates, long sessions, performance, store metadata and policy
   evidence, reproducible signed release candidate and submission preparation.

Every stage must record implemented behavior, automated evidence and remaining
hardware checks. A scaffold or editor demonstration does not complete the goal.

## Release evidence still required

- User has a Quest 3, which is the first test target. No device is connected as
  of initial inventory (`adb devices` empty).
- User confirmed there is no Meta developer-dashboard app yet. App identity and
  store setup remain required external release gates.
- Meta application identity, signing configuration, organization access and
  production authentication/attestation must be validated before submission.
- Unity 6000.3.24f1 and its Android build support are installed. Licensing works.
  The original deeply nested installation omitted long-path package metadata;
  reinstalling at `D:/Tools/Unity/6000.3.24f1` repaired it. A physical short-path
  build mirror avoids a separate package-cache rename failure in the worktree.
- Browser texture plugin choice is not yet validated against real Maestro content.
- The server's existing Stripe-only purchase route must not be exposed in a Quest
  purchase flow without reviewing the current Meta platform policy and selecting
  the supported store approach. Backend credit authority remains shared.
- Imported models/animations and default artwork need license/provenance records.
- Current chat storage is local IndexedDB; cross-device chat sync is not implied
  by using the same backend and must not be advertised without implementation.

## Verified development milestone, 2026-09-25

- Shared chat/book presentation: 121 targeted tests pass; production web build
  succeeds. Conversation and practice fixtures have been inspected in-browser.
- ARM64 browser transport: Gradle release AAR and Android lint pass (zero errors).
- Unity project compiles and configures OpenXR, scene and included clips.
  Six EditMode tests pass, including actual imported skeleton movement.
- Actual Unity desktop renders cover the physical book using a browser-captured
  page texture, the shared pencil shader, avatar views and sampled gestures.
- The user's later cartoon reference now defines the character direction.
  Current geometry is a development draft, not approved release artwork.
- User drawing/editor and model import flows, native lifecycle/authentication,
  production attestation, billing, hand interaction and device/store QA remain.
